# Welcome to My Printf
I created this version of printf to understand the c language better.

## Task
The task is to create printf, to work with different variables

## Installation

From the terminal, just run\
```
make
```
This will create the testfile in the /bin directory

## Usage

To run the my_printf testfile,
in the terminal type :
```
./bin/my_printf
```

This will then print out various test statements using my printf function.
